The AE Connect WordPress plugin integrates Appreciation Engine's rich data analytics tools with your WordPress website.

== Description ==
<h4>How can you really learn about your customers so you can create the perfect content for them?</h4> For more and more brands, social login is the answer. Social login can help you understand your ideal customers in full color. The AE Connect WordPress plugin is the best and easiest way to implement social login on your WordPress website!

<h3>Social Login</h3>
<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ae-connect/">The AE Connect WordPress plugin</a> helps marketers get a robust social login set up on their WordPress websites quickly and easily. Our dashboard allows users to view what their customers are liking, sharing, interacting with and listening to... in real time.

When your customers log onto your website using social login, they give you permission to see some of their activity, so that you can provide them with better offers and tailored content. We like to think of this as a digital handshake between the customer and the brand. That’s what we do at Appreciation Engine (<a href="http://get.theappreciationengine.com/">www.appreciationengine.com</a>), AE for short: we empower companies like Sony and UMG to better understand their customers and increase fan engagement.
